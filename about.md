## Mission

The **Machine Intelligence in Remote Sensing (MIRS)** Research Group develops intelligent AI models that turn complex Earth observation data into reliable, actionable insights for socio-econimical and environmental analyses. The research focuses on robust methods that generalize across regions and time, support decision-making, and advance transparent, trustworthy geospatial AI.

## About the Group

The group was established in February 2026 at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/home) within the [Institute for Land Resource Economics](https://www.ilr1.uni-bonn.de/en/institute-for-food-and-resource-economics).
